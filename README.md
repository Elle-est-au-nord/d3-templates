# D3 Templates

### Aim
Collect reusable templates in this repository for data viz needs.

There are script in this repo, but they might be easier to reuse as [bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/Eleonore9).

For the moment the scripts expect data as CSV files. And the templates use made up datasets.

### Examples
See the templates available [here](https://elle-est-au-nord.github.io/d3-templates/)

### How to use as a template?
Look for the section at the top of the D3 script starting with `*** EDIT TO CUSTOMISE ***`. You can then edit the data source, x and y data and axis names, label positions...
